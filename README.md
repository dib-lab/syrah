syrah!
======

syrah reads sequences from stdin and outputs subsequences containing solid
or trusted k-mers suitable for counting or MinHashing.

syrah automatically exits when it has seen enough solid k-mers (specified
with `-n`).  You can set the k-mer size with `-k`.

There are no other options because options lead to anger. Anger leads to
hate. Hate leads to suffering.
